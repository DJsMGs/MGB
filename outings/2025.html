          <p><img src="images/IMG_1306.jpg">The West Sussex MG Owners Club had been invited to take some 'old' MGs along to an open day at the MG dealer in Bognor, so it seemed like a good opportunity to take the B for a run. I could also ask other B owners some questions.</p>
          <p>The only problem was that it was raining. In fact it rained all morning and I even had to drive through a flood (the road was closed later). However, the car ran well and I didn't get wet. Some people went for a test drive in current-day 'Chinese' MGs.</p>

          <h2 id="Slindon">SADCASE Gathering at Slindon, December</h2>
          <p>The weather forecast had said it would be fine day, and it was; sunshine from dawn to dusk. Since SADCASE were advertising a meet at the Spur in Slindon, it seemed like a good idea, not only to give the MGB an outing, but also to take Angela for her first run in the B.</p>
