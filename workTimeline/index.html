          <p>In November 2025, MGB DKK 416K came with a large file of invoices for parts and work done by garages, of MOT certificates and records of past owners. The MOT certificates went back to December 2000, when the recorded milage was just under 24,000, and the invoices started in January 1998.</p>
          <p>The aim of this page is to record when major pieces of work were carried out on the car. However, the biggest piece of work, the re-shelling of the car, is not recorded since it appears to have happened sometime between 1998 and 1992 and there are no invoices. Sometimes, when there is an invoice for a part (or collection of parts), but no labour charges, it is assumed that the owner of the car at that time carried out the work.</p>
          <p>It was claimed by Milestone Classics that the car had been re-shelled about 25 years ago, but there was no evidence of this. So I enquired with British Motor Heritage. They told me where to look for a body number (see the <a href="../numbers/index.html">Numbers</a> page) and, with this information, told me:</p>
          <p>“This is one of the earlier shells produced by BMH, back when we were owned by Rover. Unfortunately, when the company was sold, a number of records from this period were lost. As a result, I am unable to give you the specific date of manufacture for your bodyshell, all I can really say is that it was manufactured prior to 1992.”</p>
          <p>They also sent me a 'Letter of Authenticity', which is now in the file.</p>
