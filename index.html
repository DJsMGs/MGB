          <p>After selling our TC in October 2025 (after more than ten years ownership) there was a large, car-shaped space in our garage. So I started to look for something that could fill it. We sold the TC because of Angela's safety concerns and the fact that it was becoming harder to put it up on axle stands and crawl around on the garage floor. Actually it's the getting up and down that takes it out of me. So we needed something in which Angela would feel more secure, that would need less mechanical work (but still provide things that I could do to improve it) and would allow us to go on longer journeys in current-day traffic. I had already decided that a Mark III MGB Roadster would fit the bill. Apart from liking the model, it would also mean that there were many MGB owners in the West Sussex MG Owners Club who could offer advice.</p>
          <p>My basic requirement was for a Mark III MGB Roadster with overdrive. Then I had a number of 'nice to haves'. If it was built in 1972, the year that we weere married, then that would be good; dark green would be my preferred colour and if it had dark brown (Autumn Leaf) upholstery then even better; wire wheels would be nice, although I quite like the Ro-style (Rubery Owen) steel wheels on that came in with that model.</p>
          <p>It turned out that there are a lot of Mark III MGBs on the market, ranging in price from £6,000 to £24,000, but only a few that were built in 1972 and painted green. There was one in green with Autumn Leaf upholstery, but the photos showed a lot of rust and it was in Birmingham! To my surprise, however, Milestone Classics at Wisborough Green had a 1972, green roadster for sale. It had black upholstery and Ro-style wheels, but it looked promising. It was advertised as:</p>
          <blockquote cite="https://www.milestoneclassics.co.uk" class="advert">
            <p>The original MGB Roadster is one of the most recognisable British sports cars ever manufactured. It brought affordable fun to the open road when launched in 1962 and today is an ideal choice for anyone looking for roof down classic car ownership.</p>
            <p>Milestone Classics are delighted to market this exceptional MGB that was the subject of a painstaking Heritage re-shell and mechanical restoration approximately 25 years ago. The ‘B’ still presents extremely well today and is a real testament to the skill &amp; knowledge of the engineer that undertook the project.</p>
            <p>Finished in iconic British Racing Green with chrome bumpers, black leather interior and today the car presents extremely well. On the road the car does not disappoint with strong mechanicals, overdrive gearbox and typical ‘B’ exhaust note.</p>
            <p>Over recent years the car has been serviced and maintained by Robin Lackford (MG Owners Club 5 Spanner Accreditation).</p>

            <p>The history file contains a variety of invoices &amp; MOTs since the Heritage Re-shell, summary of previous owners, Drivers Handbook etc.</p>
            <p>This roadster really does tick all the boxes and is marketed at significantly less than a similar restoration would cost today. Ready to drive anywhere this stunning car will provide years of pleasure and many happy memories to the lucky new owners.</p>

          <p>So on Tuesday 4th November Angela and I drove over to view it. Their 'warehouse' was crammed full of cars, with hardly space to walk between them. Of course, the B was in a corner at the back, with access only to the passenger door! Angela sat in the passenger seat and I looked over it. I'd taken a magnet (covered with insulation tape) and a bent piece of plastic covered wire. The 'sight-lines' and panel gaps looked good. I went over as much as I could reach with the magnet and I poked the wire up through the drainage holes on the near-side sill. The end of the wire was bent to 90&deg; and I could feel that the centre sill membrane was at least there. The driver's seat looks as though it has done more thatn the noted 34,000 miles, but that milage may be from when the body shell was replaced 25 years ago.</p>
          <p>After an hour looking over the car and flipping through the file of invoices I arranged to go back on the Thursday to take it for a run. I went back on my own and the car was outside ready to go. I was taken on quite a long, circular route and repeated it with me driving. It was quite smooth. I couldn't hear any 'clunks' from the transmission, synchro worked well on all gears (although I had some trouble finding the gears since they are very close) and overdrive worked on both third and fourth gears. The steering was very stable and the car kept going in a straight line.</p>
          <p>The car was advertised for £13,000, so I made an offer of £11,000 and we settled on £12,000. The car had wood veneer panels fitted over the dash. These were damaged and that on the glove box had been replaced, but with a different veneer. So Jamie Cripps agreed to remove the veneer panels and restore the black 'crinkle' paint. The next day an invoice arrived and I paid a deposit of £500. The pre-delivery checks were said to take about two weeks.</p>
          <p>The car was ready on Wednesday 19th November, so I arranged insurance cover and paid the ballance of the money. Then on Thursday Angela and I went over to Wisborough Green and I drove the car home. It was a chilly drive, but the photo above is the car sat on our drive.</p>
